# Detail Enhancement (Fixes hands, stethoscopes, small objects)
detail_enhancement:
  enabled: true  # Set to false to use faster workflow without detailers
  mode: "facedetailer"  # Options: "facedetailer" (recommended), "meshgraphormer", "basic", "none"
  # FaceDetailer: Hand & face refinement with upscaling - best quality, +60s generation time
  # MeshGraphormer: 3D hand mesh prediction - best quality, +30s generation time
  # Basic: Simple hand detection - good quality, +20s generation time  
  # None: No hand refinement - fastest, original quality
  hand_detection_threshold: 0.5
  hand_refinement_denoise: 0.5  # Higher = more aggressive fix, but may change style
  face_refinement_denoise: 0.35  # Lower for subtle face improvements
