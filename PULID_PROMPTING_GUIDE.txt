PuLID Prompting Guide - Multi-Person Scenes with Dr Hamid
========================================================================

✅ PULID IS WORKING! You generated an image successfully!

The issue: PuLID applies Dr Hamid's face to ALL people in the scene.

SOLUTIONS FOR MULTI-PERSON SCENARIOS:
========================================================================

OPTION 1: Lower PuLID Weight (Recommended)
-------------------------------------------
In "Apply PuLID Flux" node:
  weight: 1.00 → 0.6 or 0.7

This makes PuLID apply identity more selectively to the MAIN subject.

Prompts that work well:
"Dr Hamid, a professional medical doctor in white lab coat,
explaining medical charts to a patient (back to camera),
modern clinic, professional photography"

Key: Mention "Dr Hamid" or "the doctor" FIRST in prompt


OPTION 2: Use Strategic Prompt Ordering
----------------------------------------
PuLID tends to apply to the first/main subject mentioned.

GOOD PROMPTS:
✅ "professional doctor (main subject) consulting with patient (background)"
✅ "medical doctor in foreground, patient partially visible, blurred background"
✅ "doctor holding tablet, patient's hands visible in frame, shallow depth of field"

BAD PROMPTS:
❌ "patient and doctor talking" (both get same face)
❌ "two doctors discussing" (both get same face)


OPTION 3: Specify Visual Hierarchy
-----------------------------------
"professional medical doctor Dr Hamid in sharp focus, white lab coat,
explaining to patient (out of focus, back turned), 
modern hospital, bokeh background, professional photography"

Keywords that help:
• "in sharp focus" / "in foreground"
• "patient partially visible" / "patient blurred"
• "shallow depth of field" / "bokeh"
• "back to camera" / "side view" (for patient)


OPTION 4: Regional Prompting (Advanced)
----------------------------------------
Use two separate generations:
1. Generate Dr Hamid alone
2. Generate scene with patient
3. Composite them together


BEST PROMPTS FOR DR HAMID + PATIENT SCENARIOS:
========================================================================

Consultation:
"Dr Hamid, professional medical doctor in white lab coat, warm smile,
holding digital tablet, explaining medical information,
patient's hands visible holding papers (blurred),
modern clinic consultation room, soft window lighting,
professional medical photography, cinematic, 8k"

Conference/Teaching:
"Dr Hamid presenting at medical conference, confident posture,
holding microphone, gesturing professionally,
audience silhouettes visible in background (out of focus),
stage lighting, professional photography"

Team Meeting:
"Dr Hamid leading medical team discussion, seated at conference table,
other doctors partially visible (blurred, background),
modern hospital meeting room, professional photography"

Examination Room:
"Dr Hamid conducting patient examination, wearing stethoscope,
focused expression, patient partially visible on exam table (blurred),
medical equipment in background, clinical lighting"


KEY TECHNIQUES:
========================================================================

1. ALWAYS mention Dr Hamid / the doctor FIRST
2. Use parentheses for secondary subjects: "(patient in background)"
3. Add blur/focus keywords: "blurred", "out of focus", "shallow DOF"
4. Use visual hierarchy: "foreground", "background"
5. Lower weight to 0.6-0.7 for better selectivity

WEIGHT SETTINGS:
• 1.0 = Strong identity (may apply to all faces)
• 0.7-0.8 = Balanced (applies mainly to main subject)
• 0.5-0.6 = Subtle (very selective)


EXAMPLE WORKFLOW SETTINGS:
========================================================================

Apply PuLID Flux node:
  weight: 0.7
  start_at: 0.0
  end_at: 1.0

Prompt:
"Dr Hamid, professional medical doctor in white lab coat,
warm smile, consulting, patient partially visible (blurred),
modern hospital, professional photography, cinematic, 8k"

This should apply Dr Hamid's face primarily to the doctor,
while the patient gets a different, generic face!
